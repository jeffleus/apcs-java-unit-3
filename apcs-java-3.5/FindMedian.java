/*
    In this program you will ask the user for three integers and
    then print out the median (middle) value.

    Remember that a number is the median value if it is larger than one number and smaller than the other. For example, given the numbers 1, 3, 2 or the numbers 2, 3, 1, the middle number is 2.

    Use compound boolean expressions to help you.

    Example Output:

    Enter the first integer: 
    89
    Enter the second integer: 
    1000
    Enter the third integer: 
    23

    The median is 89
